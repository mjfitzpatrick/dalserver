DALServer Library Files
------------------------

build.properties
	Configuration variables for the Ant build script.

cds.jar
	Jar of compiled CDS Savot VOTable classes.

setup.csh
	Sample environment setup file.  Basically, the only external dependencies
	are Java 1.5 or greater, Ant, an application server (e.g., Apache Tomcat)
	which will include the Java servlet classes, and an XML parser such as
	Xerces.  The file catalina_ant.jar must be installed in Tomcat for the
	Ant integration to work.

ssap-table.txt
	Template code for adding SSAP keywords to a RequestResponse object (e.g.,
	for implementing the queryData operation).

spectrum-table.txt
	Template code for adding Spectrum DM keywords to a RequestResponse object
	(e.g., for implementing the getData operation to return data model-based
	datasets constructed on the fly).

ssap-keywords.csv
	A CSV version of the SSAP/Spectrum data models.  When the data model
	changes, the command "java dalserver.SsapKeywordFactory" is run to rebuild
	the DALServer SSAP and Spectrum keyword factories.  See the "main" at
	the end of the above source file for additional related utilities.
